<h2>Welcome to the AirBnB clone project :)</h2>
<br>
<h2>First Step: Writing a command  interpreter to manage all my AirBnB objects</h2>
<br>
<p>This is the first step towards building your first full web application: the AirBnB clone. This first step is very important because you will use what you build during this project with all other following projects: HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API, front-end integration</p>
<br>
<p>Each task is linked and will help:</p>
<h4>i. put in place a parent class (called BaseModel) to take care of the initialization, serialization and deserialization of your future instances</h4>
<h4>ii. create a simple flow of serialization/deserialization: Instance <-> Dictionary <-> JSON string <-> file</h4>
<h4>iii. create all classes used for AirBnB (User, State, City, Placeâ€¦) that inherit from BaseModel</h4>
<h4>iv. create the first abstracted storage engine of the project: File storage.</h4>
<h4>v. create all unittests to validate all our classes and storage engine</h4>
