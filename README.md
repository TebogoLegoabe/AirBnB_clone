###Welcome to the AirBnB clone project :)
<br>
<h2>First Step: Writing a command  interpreter to manage all my AirBnB objects</h2>
<br>
<p>This is the first step towards building your first full web application: the AirBnB clone. This first step is very important because you will use what you build during this project with all other following projects: HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API, front-end integration</p>
<br>
<p>Each task is linked and will help:</p>
i. <h4>put in place a parent class (called BaseModel) to take care of the initialization, serialization and deserialization of your future instances</h4>
ii. <h4>create a simple flow of serialization/deserialization: Instance <-> Dictionary <-> JSON string <-> file</h4>
iii. <h4>create all classes used for AirBnB (User, State, City, Placeâ€¦) that inherit from BaseModel</h4>
iv. <h4>create the first abstracted storage engine of the project: File storage.</h4>
v. <h4>create all unittests to validate all our classes and storage engine</h4>
